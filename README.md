# Strassen_matrix_multiplication_algorithms
The Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm is an efficient algorithm for large-scale matrix multiplication. It employs the divide-and-conquer approach and reorganizes additions and multiplications of elements, reducing the time complexity to O(n^2.81). When the matrix size is less than or equal to "goalsize", use ordinary matrix multiplication with openmp added. The input matrix size must be a positive integer power of 2.


this is just a toy code :)
